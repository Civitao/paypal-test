# Welcome to my test!

Paypal test made by scratch from July 13th 10:00am to July 16th 03:00am

-I wasn't able to complete the Paypal API integration due to a payload error on any payment methods without payload. While trying to solve this problem, i didn't find anything explaining the cause of the error, guess it can be cause of the repetitive renders of the Paypal Buttons at the same screen/time of the requests.
